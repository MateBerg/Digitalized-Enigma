# Digitalized-Enigma
Digitalized German Enigma Machine used for  Encrypting &amp; Decrypting - Arduino &amp; C++

## Introduction to Enigma
The Enigma machine is a cipher device developed and used in the early- to mid-20th century to protect commercial, diplomatic, and military communication. It was employed extensively by Nazi Germany during World War II, in all branches of the German military. The Enigma machine was considered so secure that it was used to encipher the most top-secret messages [Wikipedia].

The security of the system depends on machine settings that were generally changed daily, based on secret key lists distributed in advance, and on other settings that were changed for each message. The receiving station would have to know and use the exact settings employed by the transmitting station to successfully decrypt a message [Wikipedia].
